## 🚀 Favorite Project

### 📒 Data Structures Phonebook  
One of my proudest achievements: building a feature-rich phonebook application from scratch using data structures.  
It may sound simple, but implementing the right data structures and robust error handling made this project a real learning adventure!  
> _"Simple projects often have hidden complexities — that's where the magic (and the real learning) happens."_
